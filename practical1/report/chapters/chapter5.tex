\chapter{Conclusions}

In this paper we have examined different classes of methods for machine learning over molecules. We considered ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net, neural network, ensemble methods and support vector regressions. Along with these methods, we considered different ways to optimize our result restricting in ensemble / tree methods based on our previous progress, including data exploration to get more data, feature engineering to extract useful data, parameters adjustment to customize methods to the data.

Based on related work, we utilize the conclusion of molecular fingerprinting predicted HOMO-LUMO gaps with the lowest error. Though the random forest method we used did not prove to be the best teams among top 3, also we had programming problem when trying to utilize Gaussian process to process our data as submission ideas \cite{WinNT} suggested, the primary goal of this practical was exploratory, we have established a foundation for further work and started to know how to play data with machine learning.
