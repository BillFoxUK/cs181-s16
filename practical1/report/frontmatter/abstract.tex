In this report, we tackle machine learning over molecular space by considering features that "identifies" molecules. We assess the viability of different machine learning algorithms by training a regressor model to predict energy values. In particular, we look several class of models including ridge regression, lasso regression, elastic net, neural network, ensemble methods, support vector machine and Gaussian process regression, whereby the prediction algorithm relies on a feature called Morgan fingerprints and its similarity measure between training data. On the given Kaggle training data and testing data, we find a random forest regression to be the most accurate for predicting HOMO-LUMO energy gap values.
